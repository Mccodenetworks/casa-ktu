        <p>CASA KTU, the student wing of the Christ Apostolic Church International, has a rich history that spans over two decades. The vision to establish CASA KTU was born in 2002, but it wasn't until 2004 that the student body was officially approved by the authorities.
            <br>
            Abraham Oshiakor, the founder and first president of CASA KTU, played a crucial role in the establishment of the student body. He, along with a few other dedicated students, worked tirelessly to bring the vision to life. Despite facing numerous challenges, 
            they persevered and eventually succeeded in getting CASA KTU approved.<br>
            <br>
            <h4>The first executive team consisted of:</h4>
           
            *    Abraham Oshiakor (President)<br>
            *    Emmanuel Attefuah (Vice President)<br>
            *    James (Prayer Secretary)<br>
            *    Christopher Colinto Balinto (Bible Studies Coordinator)<br>
            *    Organiser (Women's Organizer)<br>
            *    Financial Secretary (Treasurer)<br>
            *    Music Director (Ecos of Judah Choir Director)<br>
            <br>
            The early days of CASA KTU were marked by fervent prayer meetings and a strong sense of community among members. The student body started with just 12 members but quickly grew as more students were drawn to the vision. Abraham Oshiakor served as the president for a year before handing over to Emmanuel Attefuah, who continued to build on the foundation laid.
            <br>
<h4>Programs and Activities:</h4>

*    Weekly Prayer Meetings (every Wednesday evening)<br>

<br>
Over the years, CASA KTU has faced its fair share of challenges, but the student body has continued to thrive. Today, CASA KTU is one of the strongest spiritual domes on campus, and its impact is felt far beyond the university community.
<br>
As CASA KTU recognizes its 20 years of impacts, it's a testament to the power of vision, perseverance, and dedication. The student body continues to be a beacon of hope and light on campus, and its history serves as a reminder of the impact that a small group of dedicated individuals can have.
